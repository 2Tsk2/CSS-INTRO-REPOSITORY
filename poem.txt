The life of a programmer 
As a programmer, it is a must to persevere every day
you move through countless of files to keep issues at bay
you organize your code to make it more beautiful 
but in the process you can suddenly introduce bugs so be careful  

You get into countless of sleepless nights, trying to work and improve
but in the end, the effort is fruitful as you wake up the next day to your code being approved
but your job doesnt end here, no, this is only the start of your journey
because you'll be here for the rest of your life, updating your code, breaking it, and fixing it countless of times in agony.
