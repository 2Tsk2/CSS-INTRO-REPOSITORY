                As a programmer, it is a must to persevere every day <br>
                you move through countless of files to keep issues at bay <br>
                you organize your code to make it more beautiful <br>
                but in the process you can suddenly introduce bugs so be careful  <br>
                <br>
                You get into countless of sleepless nights, trying to work and improve <br>
                but in the end, the effort is fruitful as you wake up the next day to your code being approved <br>
                but your job doesnt end here, no, this is only the start of your journey <br>
                because you'll be here for the rest of your life, updating your code, breaking it, and fixing it countless of times in agony. <br>
